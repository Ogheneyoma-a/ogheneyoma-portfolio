            <h1>Literature Review of Dream Count by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</h1>
            <p>
                When I first saw Adichie's post on Instagram about a new novel, I thought it would be another informative and educative book that ends just as well as <b>Americanah</b> did. But it wasn't like <b>Americanah</b>—I think it is more like <b>Purple Hibiscus</b> and <b>Half of a Yellow Sun</b>. Some prominent features of <b>Dream Count</b> that shifted my life perspectives are highlighted below:

                <h3>Portrayal of the Normalcy of Single Middle-aged Women</h3>
                <p>
                    This is arguably one of the major themes of the novel. The Nigerian society has long stigmatized single middle-aged women for not having husbands, which I believe is ridiculous. Having a husband should not be considered the most important goal for every woman. Marriage should be a choice, and society must learn to understand and respect individual choices. Adichie portrayed this perfectly by making the main character, Chiamaka (Chia), along with best friends-Zikora and Omelogor, single women in their forties. Omelogor best exemplifies this by taking pride in her career and being unbothered by her singleness. Although, as time passed, she began considering the option of adopting a child—not because she wanted one, but because of the societal pressure surrounding motherhood. This serves as a perfect example of how Nigerian society can, over time, influence one's personal choices.

                <h3>Portrayal of the Acceptance of Constant Dream Chasing</h3>
                <p>
                    Our society often forces people to label themselves and others as lazy or unserious if, by 30+, they do not have a stable job, business, career, or skill. As a result, many people end up stuck in unfulfilling professions for most of their adult lives. Adichie normalizes the idea of being a dream chaser, even in middle age, through the character of Chia. As expected, Chia's aunty criticized her decision not to pursue a stable job or join the family business, but instead to become a travel blogger. However, from Chia's perspective, we see how perfectly normal it is to choose various paths in life—as long as they bring happiness and fulfillment—even if it means constantly changing careers.

            <section id="breakups">
                <h3>Different Perspectives on Breakups</h3>
                <p>I first read Zikora's story when Adichie published it as an Amazon short story. I read it again when I turned 22, and it made more sense to me than it did the first time. This part of the book is undoubtedly my favorite. Zikora did not understand her mother's insistence on establishing a formal relationship between her (Zikora) and her stepmother when she was a child. But after her baby's father blocked her number—despite several texts telling him their son had just arrived—she finally understood her mother's actions from years ago. “Stand by me,” her mom said when Zikora, as a child, was being friendly with her step-mom. I felt that.
                </p>  
                <p>
                    Another powerful angle in Zikora's story is the idea that there are always different perspectives on breakups. I believe no one is ever completely at fault—except in cases of abuse. Zikora did everything a girlfriend in love would do. Yes, there was some miscommunication, but she gave her all. Her boyfriend also acted as the perfect boyfriendat first, but did not want to raise a child. While I believe he should have communicated better instead of leaving abruptly and being evil and heartless in the end, I also understand that his reason of not wanting a child is validated.

            <section id="inhumane treatment">
                <h3>Portrayal of the Normalcy of Inhumane Treatment of Economically Dependent People by their Benefactors</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a longstanding and persisting issue in the Nigerian society, which, honestly, should no longer exist in today's globalized world. Nigerian <i>ogas</i> and <i>madams</i> often dehumanize their workers and justify their actions with cultural norms. It should not be acceptable to raise your voice at your gatekeeper for making a mistake. It should not be acceptable to ignore the emotions of people you are financially supporting, simply because they're expected to be grateful. It should not be acceptable to speak harshly to those seeking your favour or working under you, just to assert superiority.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Omelogor illustrates this when she scolds her cook for disliking <i>okpa</i>, calling him abusive names. Adichie lets it end there—she does not condemn the behaviour. She also overlooked this issue too in <b>Americanah</b> when Ifemelu used abusive language toward his tiller, with the blame subtly shifted to her re-absorption of the Nigerian culture after living in the U.S. for years. The point is, Adichie portrays these instances of inhumane treatment without explicitly criticizing them—unlike other social issues she tackles head-on.
