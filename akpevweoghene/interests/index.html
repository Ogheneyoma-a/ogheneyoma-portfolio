   <p>I am a communication researcher. I have been enthusiastic about communication since my secondary school days when I found the magnificent world of literary fiction and its power to communicate feelings, gestures and other life occurences I could not previously explain. Deciding to study communication after this experience, I devote my life to the study and research of communication patterns, hoping to unravel the unique process behind communication and help people become better recipients of messages as well as better communicators themselves.</p>
   <p>I currently work as a <strong>teacher</strong> and <strong>corporate communication strategist</strong> at <strong>Akpevweoghene Educational Centre (AEC)</strong> and has been in this role since 2022. Prior to this, I worked as a <strong>programer</strong> at <strong>Delta Broadcasting Service, Warri</strong> for six months during my university internship program. I also volunteered as a <strong>teaching assistant</strong> in AEC during my university summer holidays, beginning from my sophomore year at university until I graduated in 2022, and delved into full-time teaching. Owing to this, I have a significant amount of experience in teaching and in mass communication to a large audience. </p>
