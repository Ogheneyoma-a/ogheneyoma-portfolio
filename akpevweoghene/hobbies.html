    <p>Akpevweoghene spends her school holidays learning new skills. She took a course on AI essentials in the summer of 2024. The course, offered by <a href="www.alxafrica.com">ALX Africa</a> and sponsored by <a href="www.mastercardfoundation.com">Mastercard Foundation</a>, explains, analizes, and teaches the relevance of artificial intelligence to all works of life, including communication. Last winter, she took another Alx/Mastercard course on virtual assistance in order to master the act and art of efficiently aiding the communication between professionals and their public physically and virtually, since the world is gradually becoming more computerised. </p>
    <p>She is currently taking a course on web development from <a href="www.coursera.com">Coursera</a> by William Mead of UC Davies, USA. She aims to master the act of web development and become a web developer as a hobby.</p>
